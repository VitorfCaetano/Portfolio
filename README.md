This repository contains my portfolio.


This is a challenge that I proposed to myself, design a website.



The main goal of this project is to see how I feel comfortable with HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript,
but at the same time, it is an opportunity to create something that I like and that I can show to people.

My portfolio is not really a professional portfolio, it is just something that I wanted to do a long time ago and maybe can help me in the future.
